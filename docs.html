        <h1>What is CPU Scheduling?</h1>
        <p>CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least selects one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.</p>

    <section class="container_docs" data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        <h1>Why CPU Scheduling?</h1>
        <p>A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time. In a uni programming system like MS-DOS, time spent waiting for I/O is wasted and CPU is free during this time. In multi programming systems, one process can use CPU while another is waiting for I/O. This is possible only with process scheduling.</p>
        <ul>
            <strong>Objectives of Process Scheduling Algorithm:</strong>
            <li>Max CPU utilization [Keep CPU as busy as possible]</li>
            <li>Fair allocation of CPU</li>
            <li>Max throughput [Number of processes that complete their execution per time unit]</li>
            <li>Min turnaround time [Time taken by a process to finish execution]</li>
            <li>Min waiting time [Time a process waits in ready queue]</li>
            <li>Min response time [Time when a process produces first response]</li>

        <h1>Real-Time CPU Scheduling</h1>
        <p>Real-time CPU scheduling is designed for systems where timeliness is critical. Real-time systems must execute tasks within strict time constraints. A failure to meet these constraints can cause system failure or unacceptable results.</p>
        <ul>
            <strong>What is Real-Time Scheduling?</strong>
            <p>Real-time CPU scheduling ensures processes are executed in a predictable manner to meet deadlines. It is primarily used in systems like:</p>
            <li>Embedded Systems (e.g., robotics, automotive systems)</li>
            <li>Multimedia Systems (e.g., video streaming)</li>
            <li>Industrial Control Systems (e.g., manufacturing)</li>
            <li>Medical Systems (e.g., MRI machines)</li>
            <strong>Real-Time Scheduling Algorithms</strong>

                <li id="imp7">Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type: Fixed Priority Scheduling.</li>
                    <li>How it Works:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assigns priorities based on process frequency (period).</li>
                        <li>Processes with shorter periods (higher frequency) get higher priority.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Assumption: Tasks are periodic and independent.</li>
                    <li>Pros: Simple and efficient for static systems.</li>
                    <li>Cons: Assumes tasks are predictable and cannot handle overloads.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Type: Dynamic Priority Scheduling.</li>
                    <li>How it Works:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assigns priorities based on deadlines.</li>
                        <li>Processes with earliest deadlines get higher priority.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Assumption: Tasks are periodic and independent.</li>
                    <li>Pros: Optimal for dynamic systems and can handle overloads.</li>
                    <li>Cons: Complex and inefficient for static systems.</li>

        <h1>Operating System Scheduling Criteria</h1>
        <p>Operating systems use different criteria to select the next process to run. These criteria help determine the efficiency and fairness of the CPU scheduling algorithm.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilization: Keep the CPU as busy as possible.</li>
            <li>Throughput: Maximize the number of processes that complete execution per time unit.</li>
            <li>Turnaround Time: Minimize the time taken for a process to finish execution.</li>
            <li>Waiting Time: Minimize the time a process waits in the ready queue.</li>
            <li>Response Time: Minimize the time taken for a process to produce the first response.</li>
            <li>Fairness: Ensure all processes get a fair share of the CPU.</li>
